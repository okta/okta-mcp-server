The Okta MCP Server integrates with LLMs and AI agents, allowing you to perform various Okta management operations using natural language. For instance, you could simply ask Claude Desktop to perform Okta management operations:

- > Create a new user and add them to the Engineering group
- > Show me all failed login attempts from the last 24 hours
- > List all applications that haven't been used in the past month

}
```

### Authenticate with Okta

The server supports two authentication methods. Choose the one that best fits your use case.

**Method 1: Device Authorization Grant (Interactive)**

1. In your Okta org, create a **new App Integration**.
2. Select **OIDC - OpenID Connect** and **Native Application**.
3. Under **Grant type**, ensure **Device Authorization** is checked.
4. Go to the Okta API Scopes tab and Grant permissions for the APIs you need (e.g., okta.users.read, okta.groups.manage).
5. Save the application and copy the **Client ID**.
6. **Documentation:** [Okta Device Authorization Grant Guide](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/device-authorization-grant/main/)

**Method 2: Private Key JWT (Browserless)**

1. **Create App:** In your Okta org, create a **new App Integration**. Select **API Services**. Save the app and copy the **Client ID**.
2. **Configure Client Authentication:**
   * On the app's **General** tab, find the **Client Credentials** section and click **Edit**.
   * Disable **Require Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP) header in token requests**.
   * Select **Public key / Private key** for the authentication method.
3. **Add a Public Key:** You have two options for adding a key.
   * **Option A: Generate Key in Okta (Recommended)**
     1. In the **Public keys** section, click **Add key**.
     2. In the dialog, choose **Generate new key**.
     3. Okta will instantly generate a key pair. **Download or save the private key** (`private.pem`) and store it securely.
     4. Copy the **Key ID (KID)** displayed for the newly generated key.
   * **Option B: Use Your Own Key**
     1. Generate a key pair locally using the following `openssl` commands:
        ```bash
        # Generate a 2048-bit RSA private key
        openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048
        
        # Extract the public key from the private key
        openssl rsa -in private.pem -pubout -out public.pem
        ```
     2. Click **Add key** and paste the contents of your **public key** (`public.pem`) into the dialog.
     3. Copy the **Key ID (KID)** displayed for the key you added.
4. **Grant API Scopes:** Go to the **Okta API Scopes** tab and **Grant** permissions for the APIs you need.
5. **Assign Admin Roles:** To avoid `403 Forbidden` errors, go to the **Admin roles** tab and assign the **Super Administrator** role to this application.

## üîê Authentication

The Okta MCP Server uses the Okta Management API and requires authentication to access your Okta tenant.

### Authentication Flow

The server uses OAuth 2.0 device authorization flow for secure authentication with Okta, or Private Key JWT for browserless authentication. Your credentials are managed securely and are never exposed in plain text.

### Initial Setup

The MCP Server will automatically initiate the appropriate authentication flow based on your configuration:

- **Device Authorization Grant**: Interactive browser-based authentication
- **Private Key JWT**: Browserless authentication using client credentials

> [!NOTE]
> Device authorization flow is not supported for **private cloud** tenants. Private Cloud users should use Private Key JWT authentication with client credentials.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Using the MCP Server will consume Management API rate limits according to your subscription plan. Refer to the [Rate Limit Policy](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/rate-limits/) for more information.

## ü©∫ Troubleshooting

When encountering issues with the Okta MCP Server, several troubleshooting options are available to help diagnose and resolve problems.

### üêû Debug Mode

Enable debug mode for more detailed logging:

```bash
export OKTA_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

> [!TIP]
> Debug mode is particularly useful when troubleshooting connection or authentication issues.

### üö® Common Issues

1. **Authentication Failures**
   - Ensure you have the correct permissions in your Okta tenant
   - Verify your `OKTA_ORG_URL`, `OKTA_CLIENT_ID`, and `OKTA_SCOPES` are correct
   - Check that your application has the necessary API scopes granted

2. **MCP Client Can't Connect to the Server**
   - Restart your MCP client after installation
   - Verify the server path is correct in your configuration
   - Check that `uv` is installed and accessible in your PATH

3. **API Errors or Permission Issues**
   - Enable debug mode with `export OKTA_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`
   - Verify your Okta application has the required scopes
   - Ensure your application has appropriate admin roles assigned
   - Check the Okta System Log for detailed error information

4. **"Claude's response was interrupted..." Error**
   - This typically happens when Claude hits its context-length limit
   - Try to be more specific and keep queries concise
   - Break large requests into smaller, focused operations

> [!TIP]
> Most connection issues can be resolved by restarting both the server and your MCP client.

## üìã Debug Logs

Enable debug mode to view detailed logs:

```bash
export OKTA_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

You can also specify a log file:

```bash
export OKTA_LOG_FILE="/path/to/okta-mcp.log"
```

## üë®‚Äçüíª Development

### Building from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/okta/okta-mcp-server.git
cd okta-mcp-server

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Run the server directly
uv run okta-mcp-server
```

### Development Scripts

```bash
# Run with debug logs enabled
OKTA_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG uv run okta-mcp-server

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Install in development mode
uv pip install -e .
```

> [!NOTE]
> This server requires [Python 3.8 or higher](https://python.org/downloads) and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

## üîí Security

The Okta MCP Server prioritizes security:

- Credentials are managed through secure authentication flows
- No sensitive information is stored in plain text  
- Authentication uses OAuth 2.0 device authorization flow or Private Key JWT
- Supports fine-grained API scope permissions
- Easy credential management through environment variables

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For security best practices, always review the permissions requested during the authentication process to ensure they align with your security requirements.

> [!CAUTION]
> Always use the principle of least privilege when granting API scopes to your Okta application.
